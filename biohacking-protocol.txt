The Protocol

Day -30: Washout Period
Day 0: Snapshot #1 & Begin Preferred Biohacking Regimen
Day 45: Snapshot #2
Day 90: Snapshot #3 & End of Biohacking Challenge

Washout Period
We’ll start by doing a 30-day washout period. For new biohackers, this means maintaining your typical regimen. For seasoned biohackers, this means “washing out” by stopping all biohacks and going back to “normal” regimen to see what your baseline is. 

During Day 0 - Day 90, the biohacker will do a battery of continuous monitoring, daily monitoring, weekly monitoring, and Snapshot (Day 0, Day 45, Day 90) measurements.
